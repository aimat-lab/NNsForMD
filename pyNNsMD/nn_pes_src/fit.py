"""
Main interface to start training_??.py scripts in parallel. This can be solved in many different ways.

Possible are server solutions with slurm and MPI. Here only python subprocess are started to local machine.
The training scripts are supposed to read all necessary information from folder. 
NOTE: Path information of folder and training scripts as well as os info are made fetchable but could fail in certain
circumstances.
