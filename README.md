# Usage

#### Ensemble
The main class ``pyNNsMD.NNsMD.NeuralNetEnsemble`` holds a list of keras models and custom scaler classes to transform or standardize input/output.
Construction of ``NeuralNetEnsemble`` requires a filepath and the number of model instances to keep.

```python
from pyNNsMD.NNsMD import NeuralNetEnsemble
nn = NeuralNetEnsemble("TestEnergy/", 2)
```

Adding the models and scaler classes to ``NeuralNetEnsemble`` via `create`. 
Custom classes can be added to the modules in ``pyNNsMD.models`` and ``pyNNsMD.scalers``, 
but which must implement proper config and weight handling. 
Note that data format between model and scaler must be compatible.
Instead of class instances a deserialization via keras config-dictionaries is supported for `create`.

```python
from pyNNsMD.models.mlp_e import EnergyModel
from pyNNsMD.scaler.energy import EnergyStandardScaler
nn.create(models=[EnergyModel(atoms=12, states=2), EnergyModel(atoms=12, states=2)],
          scalers=[EnergyStandardScaler(), EnergyStandardScaler()])
```

The models and scaler must be saved to disk to prepare for training, which includes config and weights.

```python
nn.save()
```

#### Data

The data is stored to the directory specified in ``NeuralNetEnsemble``.
Data format passed to ``NeuralNetEnsemble.data`` must be nested python-only lists.
The geometries are stored as `.xyz` and everything else as `.json`.

```python
atoms = [["C", "C"]]
geos = [[[0.147, 0.024, -0.680], [-0.165, -0.037, 0.652]]]
energy = [[-20386.37, -20383.93]]

nn.data(atoms=atoms, geometries=geos, energies=energy)
# nn.data_path("data_dir/") if data can't be saved in working directory.
```
